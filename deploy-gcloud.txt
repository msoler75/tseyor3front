This article will help you deplyoing a Nuxt 2.0 application to Google’s App Engine — in no time 🔥.
❗️️Update: I now also updated the official Nuxt documentation with a guide for Google App Engine, check it out: https://nuxtjs.org/faq/appengine-deployment
2) Setting Up the App on App Engine
⏭ skip to section 3 if you already have the set up your App Engine App ⏭
❗️️If you haven’t set up a Google Cloud account and a project yet, please do so now on console.cloud.google.com. This is documented well in Google’s documentation and is not covered in this article.
Now visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine and click on “Enable App Engine”. You go through a very short setup process and should have your App Engine enabled and see this screen:

Done, your App Engine application is ready to be deployed to.
3) Downloading & Installing the Cloud CLI
⏭ skip to section 4 if you already have Google’s Cloud CLI up and running ⏭
Visit https://cloud.google.com/sdk and follow the instructions there to download and init the CLI on your local machine with your Google Cloud account.
4) Deploying your App to App Engine
Now the interesting part. Back in your Nuxt applications main folder, create a file called app.yaml with the following content:
runtime: nodejs10
instance_class: F2
handlers:
  - url: /_nuxt
    static_dir: .nuxt/dist/client
    secure: always
  - url: /(.*\.(gif|png|jpg|ico|txt))$
    static_files: static/\1
    upload: static/.*\.(gif|png|jpg|ico|txt)$
    secure: always
  - url: /.*
    script: auto
    secure: always
env_variables:
  HOST: '0.0.0.0'
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
That’s already it when it comes to setup! Now run the following command in your CLI:
npm run build
This will run “nuxt build” and build your current project into the “.nuxt” folder. The app is now ready to be uploaded and deployed to the App Engine.
Run the following command:
gcloud app deploy app.yaml -project <project-id>
❗️️ Make sure to replace “<project-id>” with your App Engine project-id! Your App has a name and an ID, which can be totally different. Make sure here to put in the app’s ID , not the app’s name.

Click on the link provided in the CLI and… tadaaa! Your app is up and running on the Google App Engine! 🎉🎉🎉
Now just make sure to always build your project before uploading it, the App Engine does not automatically build it for you in this case. :)

I am using the second cheapest instance F2 here because the 128 MB of memory provided in the F1 instance does not seem to suffice for a Nuxt application. Be aware that this instance is not free to be run 24/7.
